# BookCatalogue

This is a very simple JAVA 8 program for parsing .csv files (a book catalogue in this case) and displaying the information without any user interaction.

After parsing the files, you are able to:
1. Get all publications
2. Find a book/magazine by ISBN
3. Get all publications for an Author (given his email)
4. Get all publications sorted by title.
